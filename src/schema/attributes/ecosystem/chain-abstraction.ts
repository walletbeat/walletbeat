    Ethereum activity is not limited to the main L1 chain; a lot of activity

    complexity and fragmentation for users and wallets to deal with.
    They must now deal with token balances fragmented across multiple chains.

    To address the UX impact of this complexity, wallets should provide
    features to abstract away these issues, while remaining transparent to
    the user when cross-chain bridging risks or fees are involved.
  `),
	methodology: markdown(`
    Wallets are rated based on how much of the complexity involved in dealing
    with multiple chains is abstracted away from users, while keeping risks
    and fees transparent.

    To get a passing rating, wallets must be cross-chain aware in how they
    display account value and individual token balances:

    - When displaying the user account's total value, this value should sum
      up the user's valuations across all chains the wallet supports by
      default.
    - When displaying a specific token's balance, the balance should reflect
      the user's total balance for this token across all chains that the
      wallet supports by default (and on which the token exists). For rating
      purposes, Walletbeat looks specifically at Ether and USDT balances.

    In addition, wallets must make it easy for users to move their assets
    across chains when needed. To get a passing rating, wallets must provide
    a built-in bridging feature.

    - This bridging feature must explain the risks involved in bridging assets
      across chains. Our friends at [L2BEAT](https://l2beat.com/) do a
      fantastic job documenting this, but wallet developers also have a duty
      to explain these risks to their users.
    - For bridge operations where the net fee is larger than 1bps, the wallet
      must display the fee breakdown by default.
    - When the user attempts to send tokens to an address on a chain where the
      user's own balance is insufficient, but for which there is sufficient
      balance on another chain, the wallet should automatically propose to use
      this bridging feature in order to perform the transaction.
