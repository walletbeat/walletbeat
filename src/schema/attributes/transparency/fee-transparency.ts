		Fee transparency is crucial for users to understand the full cost of their transactions.
		Without clear fee information, users may be surprised by high transaction costs or
		hidden fees charged by the wallet.
		
		Transparent fee disclosure helps users make informed decisions about when to transact
		and which wallet to use. It also builds trust between users and wallet providers by
		ensuring that all costs are clearly communicated upfront.
		
		Additionally, understanding the purpose of a transaction is important for security.
		When users can clearly see what they're authorizing (e.g., a token swap, NFT purchase,
		or contract interaction), they're less likely to approve malicious transactions.
	`),
  methodology: markdown(`
		Wallets are evaluated based on how transparently they display transaction fees and
		transaction purposes to users.
		
		A wallet receives a passing rating if it provides comprehensive fee information,
		including detailed breakdowns of network fees, clear disclosure of any additional
		wallet fees, and clear explanation of transaction purposes.
		
		A wallet receives a partial rating if it provides some fee information but lacks
		complete transparency in one or more areas.
		
		A wallet fails this attribute if it provides minimal or no fee information before
		transaction confirmation.
