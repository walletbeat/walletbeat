	methodology: markdown(`
		Wallets are assessed based on whether a third-party can learn that
		two or more of the user's wallet addresses belong to the same user.

		A third-party may learn of this correlation either through:

		- The wallet software explicitly sending this data (e.g. through
		  analytics)
		- Requesting data about multiple wallet addresses in bulk, allowing
		  the receiving endpoint to learn that all of these addresses belong to
		  the same user. Similar correlations are also possible by IP and/or
			time-based correlation of requests that each contain one wallet address.

		In order to prevent this information from being revealed, wallets can
		use a variety of strategies:

		* Wallets may offer the user to only have one active wallet address at
			a time, and only ever makes requests about the active wallet address.
			The user is expected to not change their active address often.
			The wallet should also ensure that any account-switching widget does
			not cause bulk/simultaneous requests about multiple addresses to the
			same endpoint, such as for refreshing balances.
			Note that this scheme, while simple to implement, is incompatible with
			stealth addresses. This is because stealth addresses inherently require
			the user to simultaneously manage a range of addresses.
		* Wallets may look up information about multiple addresses by splitting
			up the requests such that each request only contains one address, then
			sending these requests over different proxy circuits in a manner that
			staggers the requests over time. This ensures that the receiving
			endpoint cannot correlate addressed based on timing or IP address.
		* Wallets may distribute requests across multiple RPC endpoints owned by
			separate entities for each wallet address, preventing each entity from
			learning more than one wallet address.
