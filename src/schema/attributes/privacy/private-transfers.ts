		Data posted on public blockchains like Ethereum is publicly available to
		everyone. This means that anyone can see your transaction history.
		You would not voluntarily post your bank statements or private purchase
		history online, yet this is what happens by default when transacting
		on public blockchains.

		Many privacy solutions have emerged to solve this problem. However, to
		be actually usable by users, **these solutions must be tightly integrated
		in wallets** and easy to use. Walletbeat looks at whether wallets
		let users send, receive, and spend tokens privately by default.

	methodology: markdown(`
		In order to get a passing rating, wallets must ensure that sending Ether
		or ERC-20 tokens to other addresses comes with privacy guarantees
		**by default**. In addition, they must ensure that users can receive and
		spend such tokens privately.

		"Privately" here means that other than the wallet user, no single entity
		(including any third-party provider) can infer or reconstruct the user's
		transaction history.

		Walletbeat currently recognizes the following privacy-preserving token
