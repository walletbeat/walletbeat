		Hardware wallets are physical devices that store a user's private keys offline,

		private keys isolated from internet-connected devices, hardware wallets protect
		users from malware, phishing attacks, and other security vulnerabilities that
		could compromise their funds.
		
		When a software wallet supports hardware wallet integration, users can enjoy
		the convenience and features of the software wallet while maintaining the
		security benefits of keeping their private keys offline. This combination
		offers the best of both worlds: a user-friendly interface with enhanced security.
