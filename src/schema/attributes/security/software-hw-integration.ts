		Software wallets that integrate well with hardware wallets provide users with the best of both worlds:

		key storage and transaction signing.
		
		EIP-712 clear signing is particularly important for DeFi applications like Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe)
		and Aave, where complex transaction parameters need to be verified to prevent attacks like blind signing
		exploits or transaction parameter manipulation.
		
		When a software wallet properly integrates with hardware wallets for clear signing on these platforms,
		users can confidently verify exactly what they're approving on their hardware device screen, even for
		complex smart contract interactions.
		
		Without proper integration, users may be forced to blind sign transactions or use less secure methods,
		significantly increasing security risks when interacting with DeFi protocols.

		two different hardware wallet brands (e.g., Ledger, Trezor) on both Safe and Aave. This means users can
		clearly verify all transaction details on their hardware wallet screens when interacting with these platforms.
		
		A wallet receives a partial rating if it implements EIP-712 clear signing but with limitations, such as
		supporting only one hardware wallet brand or only one of the major DeFi platforms (either Safe or Aave but not both).
