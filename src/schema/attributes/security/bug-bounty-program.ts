		Hardware wallets manage sensitive cryptographic keys and access to users' funds, making them high-value targets for attackers.
		Bug bounty programs incentivize security researchers to responsibly discover and disclose vulnerabilities, rather than exploit them.
		
		A well-structured bug bounty program:
		1. Provides clear guidelines for researchers to report vulnerabilities
		2. Offers appropriate rewards based on severity of findings
		3. Demonstrates a commitment to addressing security issues quickly
		4. Communicates transparently about discovered vulnerabilities and their resolution
		
		Additionally, hardware wallets should provide upgrade paths for users when critical security issues are discovered,
		as these physical devices can't always be fixed with simple software updates.

			- Offers upgrade paths for users when needed

			- Basic vulnerability disclosure policy but no formal rewards
			- Limited scope or small rewards
			- Slower response times
			- Unclear upgrade paths for users

		3. **Fail**: No bug bounty program or security update process:
			- No formal process for reporting vulnerabilities
			- No incentives for responsible disclosure
