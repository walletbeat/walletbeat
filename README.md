## Special Thanks

A special thank you goes out to [@polymutex](https://github.com/polymutex) & [@fluidkey](https://github.com/fluidkey) for their kickstart & continued support of this project.

## SEO

The site automatically generates a sitemap.xml file using the @astrojs/sitemap integration. The sitemap will be available at `https://wallet.page/sitemap-index.xml` after building the site.

To configure the site URL for sitemap generation, update the `SITE_URL` in the `.env` file or set it as an environment variable.
