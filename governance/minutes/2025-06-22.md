  - Then multiply it by 2 and then add one month.
- Determine the need for further meetings, and _if_ so, desired cadence.
- Governance structure, non-profit etc. Maybe as another call?
  - Could also have lighter structure without legal entity?
  - Onchain entity with multisig.
  - Multisig members: polymutex, darrylyeo(?), lucemans, nconsigny, Hugoo(?)
  - 2 grants for full-time funding granted from the EF. Could be split across more people.

### Pre-launch roadmap items

- **Software wallets**
  - **Finalize software wallet attribute set**
    - Owner: polymutex
    - Attributes we know we still need:
      - **Security**
        - Transaction simulation fidelity (security/anti-scam feature)
        - Foolproof account recovery:
          - Needs further thought as to how it works.
          - How should the wallet ensure the user can recover their wallet?
            - EOAs: Nagging to save the seed phrase / interval phased verifications
            - 4337 wallets:
              - Social sign-in/recovery: Email recovery is only viable if privacy-preserving
              - 4337 wallet should have a recovery module
                - Example: zkEmail as guardian, works with Alchemy module smart account standard 7579 / 4337. Enables adding guardians to the wallet, creates additional recovery options. [https://github.com/zkemail#account-recovery](https://github.com/zkemail#account-recovery)
                - Safe wallet has recovery module
                - ERC-7579: Minimal Modular Smart Accounts
              - “PARTIAL”: You can add the recovery module yourself
              - Upcoming standardization work for such modules
      - **Privacy**
        - Private transfers: Need more options than just Stealth Addresses
          - Privacy Pools, Tornado Cash, Railgun, Aztec, others?
        - Per-dapp addresses (per [Vitalik privacy roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-maximally-simple-l1-privacy-roadmap/23459))
          - No prominent ERC exists here… Maybe [ERC-7763](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7763-app-keys-for-fully-embedded-accounts/20958)? But this reveals private key to the dapp.
      - **Transparency**
        - Something about transaction orderflow transparency/MEV protection
          - Work from RIG (Robust Incentives Group), interested in orderflow.
          - Most wallets don’t currently explain where orderflow goes.
          - Big builders vs small builders.
          - Transparency vs configurability?
            - Probably too much to ask for configurability. Transparency is the minimum.
          - RIG would define what the attribute look like. Detailed data analysis on whether transactions are private to which builder. Measure execution quality metrics, reordering slippage.
          - Agreements with wallet teams for disclosure of changes.
          - Agreements on the builder side to match this up.
      - **Ecosystem**
        - EIP-7702: Reject/warn against unknown redelegation transactions
        - EIP-7702: Transaction batch support (WalletCall support already added, but not yet taken into account by any attribute)
        - EIP-7702: Fee sponsorship support / non-native-token gas payments?
        - Standards adherence: Easy-to-understand ERC-4361 (SIWE) support
          - Mostly left-and-forgotten by spruce.id
          - Tooling exists, spec doesn’t need much maintenance
          - Should Walletbeat have this as attribute? Not crucial but yes. Payload is readable by default, so graceful fallback. Extra confidence if the wallet processes it nicely. But not a requirement for stage 1.
  - **Finish rating at least 6 software wallets**
    - Already done or nearly done: Rabby, Daimo, Ambire
    - MetaMask: polymutex
    - Coinbase Wallet: nconsigny
    - Rainbow: Hugoo
    - More? Anyone wants to rate their daily driver wallet?
      - Phantom? Trust Wallet? Uniswap wallet?
      - Uniswap wallet: What does it correspond to vs embedded uniswap wallet?
- **Finalize hardware wallet attribute set**
- **Rate at least 3** **hardware wallets**
  - Blocked on wallet attribute set finalization
    - Ledger: Hugo
      - Nano S Plus/X
      - Flex/Stax: Hugo
    - Trezor: Needs owner (Nico can do)
    - Keystone? GridPlus? Needs owner
    - Alternative: Hide the hardware wallet tab from homepage until done
- **Finalize the “stage” system**
  - Owner: polymutex
  - Already started on stage 1
  - Tentative definition: [https://github.com/walletbeat/walletbeat/issues/173](https://github.com/walletbeat/walletbeat/issues/173)
- **Make wallet data easy to fill in or rectify**
  - **Owner: nconsigny**
  - Probably just documentation at first.
  - Ambire went through this; maybe check with them what they found difficult: [https://github.com/walletbeat/walletbeat/pull/127](https://github.com/walletbeat/walletbeat/pull/127)
  - Longest item to review: Address privacy (need to audit every single network request)
    - (Longer-term idea: Create reproducible sandboxed wallet tests)
- **Establish a common UX theme for the site**
  - Owner: Hugoo → can draft logo / color palette
  - Would be good to find an artist or UX/design person to work on logo, favicons, press materials, etc.
  - Issue: [https://github.com/walletbeat/walletbeat/issues/80](https://github.com/walletbeat/walletbeat/issues/80)
- **Flesh out EIP-7702 adoption tracker**
  - Owner: polymutex
  - Funded by EF Pectra Proactive Grant Round.
  - Skeleton exists, needs more EIP-7702 attribute data to be entered
  - \=> Do it if 2 weeks or less of work

### Action items

- polymutex: Go over unmerged ‘main’ branch PRs and update them
- Add software wallet / hardware wallet integration details
- Add attributes for software wallet integration details (can it display DeFi frontend transactions clearly)
- Stage 1: Should this include software/hardware wallet integration level?
  - Probably not a high bar for stage 1, but definitely for stage 2
  - Have a strong consensus on the wallet stage system before launch
- Set GitHub org logo
- Schedule call for governance discussion specifically
- Create multisig for holding `walletbeat.eth`

### **Main Segments of the Call**

#### **1. Roadmap Doc Review**

**Topic**: Review of the 2025 roadmap document.  
**Purpose**: Align on priorities and assign ownership for pre-launch, post-launch, and long-term tasks.  
**Problem/Solution**:

- **Problem**: Ambiguity in the roadmap’s structure (pre-launch, post-launch, 2025).
- **Solution**: Split priorities into three categories and prioritize finalized attribute sets, wallet ratings, and stage systems.  
  **Debate/Unresolved Questions**:
- **Hardware wallet attribute set**: Less defined than software wallets.
- **Stage system**: Need for consensus on criteria to avoid frequent post-launch changes.  
  **Actions**:
- Assign ownership of tasks (e.g., polymutex for attribute sets, Hugo for hardware wallets).
- Finalize attribute sets for software and hardware wallets.

---

#### **2. UX Revamp and Score Hiding**

**Topic**: Astro/Svelte UI revamp and hiding wallet scores.  
**Purpose**: Improve user experience and avoid misleading numerical scores.  
**Problem/Solution**:

- **Problem**: Scores may mislead users into thinking a wallet is "better" based on a single number.
- **Solution**: Hide scores publicly but keep them internally for sorting.  
  **Debate/Unresolved Questions**:
- **Debate**: Whether to show scores as stages (e.g., "Stage 1," "Stage 2") or as letter grades (A/B/C).  
  **Actions**:
- Hide scores by default; revisit in the future.
- Finalize stage system criteria before launch.

---

#### **3. Logo and Branding Needs**

**Topic**: Designing a logo and UX theme for the Walletbeat site.  
**Purpose**: Create a cohesive brand identity.  
**Problem/Solution**:

- **Problem**: Current logo is placeholder and unmemorable.

  **Actions**:
- Hugoo and Luc to draft logo ideas.
- Update GitHub repo icon.

---

#### **4. Pre-Launch Responsibilities**

**Topic**: Assigning ownership for critical tasks.  
**Purpose**: Ensure all pre-launch items are addressed.  
**Problem/Solution**:

- **Problem**: Gaps in wallet ratings and attribute sets.
- **Solution**: Assign tasks (e.g., Nico for Trezor, Hugo for Ledger, polymutex for stage system).  
  **Actions**:
- Finalize software/hardware attribute sets.
- Rate at least 6 software wallets (need: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow).
- Finalize hardware wallet ratings (need: Ledger, Trezor, GridPlus).

---

#### **5. EIP-7702 Adoption Tracker**

**Topic**: Tracking EIP-7702 adoption (e.g., transaction batching, fee sponsorship).  
**Purpose**: Align with Ethereum Foundation grants and improve transparency.  
**Problem/Solution**:

- **Problem**: Current tracker lacks data on EIP-7702 attributes.
- **Solution**: Add attributes (e.g., transaction batching, fee sponsorship) and prioritize if ≤2 weeks of work.  
  **Debate/Unresolved Questions**:
- **Debate**: Whether to delay launch if EIP-7702 tracking is not ready.  
  **Actions**:
- polymutex to work on EIP-7702 tracker development.
- Prioritize if it takes ≤2 additional weeks; otherwise, delay.

---

#### **6. Governance and Legal Structure**

**Topic**: Organizational structure (nonprofit, multisig, grants).  
**Purpose**: Define governance for long-term sustainability.  
**Problem/Solution**:

- **Problem**: Uncertainty about legal entity (nonprofit vs. lightweight structure).
- **Solution**: Explore nonprofit formation and on-chain multisig for `walletbeat.eth`.
- **Debate**: Whether to include wallet teams in multisig (risk of conflicts of interest).  
  **Actions**:
- Schedule a follow-up call for governance structure discussion.
- Finalize multisig members (polymutex, darrylyeo?, lucemans, nconsigny, Hugoo?).

---

#### **7. Technical Debt and Documentation**

### **High-Level Summary of the Call**

The meeting focused on finalizing the **2025 roadmap** for Walletbeat, with a strong emphasis on **pre-launch priorities**:

1. **Attribute Sets**: Finalizing criteria for software/hardware wallets, including security (transaction simulation, recovery), privacy (private transfers, per-dapp addresses), and transparency (orderflow).
2. **Wallet Ratings**: Rating at least 6 software wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet) and 3 hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger, Trezor).
3. **UX Improvements**: Hiding attribute group scores, revamping the UI with Astro/Svelte, and designing a cohesive brand.
4. **EIP-7702 Tracking**: Prioritizing adoption of EIP-7702 features (e.g., transaction batching).
5. **Governance**: Planning for a nonprofit structure, on-chain multisig for `walletbeat.eth`, and securing EF grants.

**Key Decisions**:

- Attribute group scores will be hidden publicly but retained internally for sorting.
- Attribute set needs to be finalized before wallets can be rated.
- Will rate a minimum of 6 software wallets and 3 hardware wallets.
- A follow-up call is needed for governance and legal structure.

**Next Steps**:

- Finalize attribute sets and wallet ratings.
- Revamp the UI and design a logo.
- Schedule a governance call and finalize multisig members.
