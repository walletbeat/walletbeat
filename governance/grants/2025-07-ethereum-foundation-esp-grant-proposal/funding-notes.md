On 2025-07-23, polymutex and PatrickAlphaC came to the agreement that, for the purpose of this initial EF grant proposal, all proceeds which would have gone to PatrickAlphaC should instead go to the Walletbeat treasury.
In return, PatrickAlphaC will get to singlehandedly dictate how such funds should be spent, even if this goes against the opinions of other treasury members, so long as such expenses abide by Walletbeat's governance rules.
This document serves as a record of this agreement such that it can be referred to in the future when PatrickAlphaC would like to exercise this right.
