# TypeScript Type System Integrity

- Do not modify existing TypeScript types (interfaces, type aliases, generics, branded types, etc.) or introduce new ones that alter public APIs **without explicit confirmation from the user first**.
- If a type adjustment is deemed necessary, outline the proposed change and its impact, then wait for user approval before applying it.
