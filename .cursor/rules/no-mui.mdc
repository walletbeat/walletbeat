# MUI deprecation

- This codebase is migrating away from MUI. So avoid MUI component modifications.
- Instead prefer tailwind classes wherever possible. You can reference the tailwind.config.js for the available colors.
- The global.css file contains the colors in css variable form in order to support better theming.
