## Example Entry: Rabby (Scam Prevention)

This is an example of how a completed entry would look for Rabby's Scam Prevention:

- **attributeCategory**: security
- **ID**: scamPrevention
- **Display Name**: Scam Prevention
- **Rating**: PARTIAL
- **Short Explanation**: Rabby implements features to warn users about potential scams but with some privacy trade-offs.

## Details

Rabby provides warnings about potential scam activities when using the wallet. Given that blockchain transactions are very difficult to reverse, these warnings help users avoid falling victim to scams.

The wallet implements the following types of warnings:
